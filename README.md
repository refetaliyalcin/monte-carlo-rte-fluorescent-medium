It solves RTE in fluorescent medium.

It can handle scattering in the medium due to phosphor particles.
It can handle luminescent cascade where absorption and emission spectra of fluorescence overlaps
It can handle non-flourescent absorbing medium by modifiying quantum yield accordingly and calculating refraction angle at the air-medium interface considering both n and k of the medium.
It can handle up-conversion and down-conversion

The code works on both MATLAB and Octave.
